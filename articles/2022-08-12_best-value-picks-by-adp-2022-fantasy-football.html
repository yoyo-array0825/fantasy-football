Knowing who to draft is great, but knowing when to take your guys is both an art and a science. Take your man too early and you risk grabbing him at his ceiling and passing on other players who have more upside baked into their cost. Wait on your athlete too long and someone else might grab him.<p></p><p>Taking a look at our <a href="https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/adp/overall.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average draft position (ADP)</a> and practicing mock drafts in <a href="https://draftwizard.fantasypros.com/football/mock-draft-simulator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Draft Wizard’s Mock Draft Simulator</a> are great ways to develop a sense of when the players you seek might come off the board. Not only that, but understanding each player’s range of outcomes will allow you to judge whether each one is fairly priced, undervalued or overvalued relative to their ADP.
