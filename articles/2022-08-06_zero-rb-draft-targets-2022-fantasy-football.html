Dillon is the top pick if you’re using the zero-RB strategy.</p></div><div id="entry-content"> <p>How does the <a href="https://www.fantasypros.com/2022/06/zero-rb-redraft-draft-strategy-2022-fantasy-football/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero-RB draft strategy work</a>? You don’t avoid running backs during the entire draft, just the first handful of rounds. Typically you wait until the fifth or sixth round to draft your first running back using this strategy. Instead of targeting running backs early in your draft, you want to load up at other positions.</p><p>Ideally, you want to secure a stud wide receiver, an elite tight end, and a top-tier quarterback. The point of this strategy is to sacrifice at running back to have a star-studded lineup at other positions.</p><p>While the Zero-RB strategy works in all scoring leagues, it is the easiest to execute in PPR leagues. This strategy works best in PPR scoring leagues because pass-catching running backs can offer top-24 performances some weeks. It is also a more appealing strategy in Superflex leagues as teams will let running backs slide as they load up on quarterbacks early in the draft.</p><p>Let’s look at which types of running backs you want to target with a <a href="https://www.fantasypros.com/2022/06/zero-rb-redraft-draft-strategy-2022-fantasy-football/">Zero-RB strategy</a> and some players you will want to draft.</p><p><a href="https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/adp/ppr-overall.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>ADP via FantasyPros</i></a></p><h3><b>Types of Zero-RB Candidates </b></h3><p><b>High Upside Backups</b></p><p>Arguably the most important type of running back to target is high upside/valuable backups. These players are not the most valuable running back on their team but have a path to a top-24 finish. Ideally, their path shouldn’t require a long-term injury to the starter. These running backs could also be players who have a shot at replacing the current starter.</p><p><b>Valuable Handcuffs</b></p><p>Targeting other teams’ handcuffs is the key to successfully pulling off a Zero-RB draft strategy. Every year running backs get hurt, whether for a few weeks or the entire season. However, not every handcuff is worth targeting. You want to draft the running backs who can consistently provide top-24 performances while the starter is out.</p><p><b>PPR Stars</b></p><p>Running backs who don’t provide much fantasy value on the ground are borderline worthless in non-PPR or standard scoring. However, they are excellent safe floor players in PPR scoring and provide critical value when using a Zero-RB draft strategy. Usually, any running back that averages 3.5 or more receptions per game scores at least 10 PPR fantasy points per contest. These running backs won’t win you the league, but they will provide a safe floor option for your RB2 slot.</p><h3><b>Running Backs to Target</b></h3><p><b><a class="fp-player-link fp-id-19358" href="https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/players/aj-dillon.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-fp-id="19358">AJ Dillon (RB – GB)</a><div class="fp-icon__container"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="fp-icon__link fp-id-19358 gb_unavailable fp-news-icon" title="Open Player Card" data-fp-id="19358" data-fp-index="0"><span class="fp-icon__icon"></span></a></div>:</b><b>&nbsp;ADP </b><b>66.3</b><b> | </b><b>RB27</b></p><p>If you use a Zero-RB strategy, Dillon is the running back you want on your team.

Meanwhile, Dillon has a path to a top-24 finish even if Jones plays all 17 games. He had seven top-24 weekly finishes despite playing only 42.6% of the snaps last season. Furthermore, Dillon had 12 touches inside the five-yard line last season and should earn most of the goal line work in 2022. Dillon has a top-24 floor and top-five upside if Jones misses time.</p><p><b><a class="fp-player-link fp-id-18705" href="https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/players/tony-pollard.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-fp-id="18705">Tony Pollard (RB – DAL)</a><div class="fp-icon__container"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="fp-icon__link fp-id-18705 gb_unavailable fp-news-icon" title="Open Player Card" data-fp-id="18705" data-fp-index="2"><span class="fp-icon__icon"></span></a></div>: ADP 82.7 | RB33</b></p><p>Ever since he entered the NFL, Pollard has been a favorite of the fantasy football community. He averaged a career-high 5.5 yards per rushing attempt last season. Furthermore, he had a career-high 719 rushing yards last year. More importantly, Pollard looked like the best running back on the roster as <a class="fp-player-link fp-id-15498" href="https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/players/ezekiel-elliott.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-fp-id="15498">Ezekiel Elliott</a><div class="fp-icon__container"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="fp-icon__link fp-id-15498 gb_unavailable fp-news-icon" title="Open Player Card" data-fp-id="15498" data-fp-index="3"><span class="fp-icon__icon"></span></a></div>struggled at times in 2021. Despite Ezekiel Elliott playing all 17 games and averaging 16.7 touches per contest, Pollard was the RB28 last season. He averaged 10.4 PPR fantasy points per game despite averaging only 11.3 touches per contest. If Elliott struggles to start the year, Pollard could take over as the lead guy and turn into a top-12 running back.</p><p><b><a class="fp-player-link fp-id-18621" href="https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/players/alexander-mattison.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-fp-id="18621">Alexander Mattison (RB – MIN)</a><div class="fp-icon__container"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="fp-icon__link fp-id-18621 gb_unavailable fp-news-icon" title="Open Player Card" data-fp-id="18621" data-fp-index="4"><span class="fp-icon__icon"></span></a></div></b><b>: ADP </b><b>124.2</b><b> | </b><b>RB41</b></p><p>Mattison is the most valuable handcuff in fantasy football.

Last year, Mattison averaged 21.7 fantasy points per game in his four starts. He scored at least 16 fantasy points in every game. Furthermore, Mattison has started seven games in his career. In those games, he has averaged 20.1 fantasy points per contest. Over a full-season pace, Mattison would have been the RB3 in 2021 and the RB4 in 2020. While it might only be for a few weeks, Mattison is the ideal handcuff to draft regardless of your strategy.</p><p><b><a class="fp-player-link fp-id-16230" href="https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/players/jd-mckissic.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-fp-id="16230">J.D.

He has averaged six targets per game and 1.51 fantasy points per target during his time with Washington, averaging 1.25 fantasy points per touch. Furthermore, McKissic has averaged 9.1 fantasy points per contest in the passing game the past two years. Over a 17-game space, McKissic would have been the RB29 last year with only his 9.1 fantasy points per contest in the passing game average. While the Commanders added a couple of rookie pass catchers this season, don’t expect that to limit McKissic’s fantasy value. After re-signing the veteran to a two-year deal this offseason, McKissic will continue to have a consistent role in Washington’s passing attack.</p><p><b><a class="fp-player-link fp-id-22763" href="https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/players/khalil-herbert.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-fp-id="22763">Khalil Herbert (RB – CHI)</a><div class="fp-icon__container"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="fp-icon__link fp-id-22763 gb_unavailable fp-news-icon" title="Open Player Card" data-fp-id="22763" data-fp-index="7"><span class="fp-icon__icon"></span></a></div>: ADP 189.4 | RB59</b></p><p>Even though he was a sixth-round pick, Herbert was a productive fantasy player last year.

Furthermore, he was the RB18 during those four weeks. At the very least, Herbert is one of the top handcuffs in fantasy football. Yet, he could have more value this season. Chicago’s new offensive coordinator, Luke Getsy, came from Green Bay. Last year, they used a two-running back situation, and Getsy could decide to use Montgomery and Herbert this season as a 1-2 punch. You should use a late-round pick on Herbert and see how the Chicago backfield shakes out in Week 1.</p><p><b><a class="fp-player-link fp-id-16407" href="https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/players/donta-foreman.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-fp-id="16407">D’Onta Foreman (RB – CAR)</a><div class="fp-icon__container"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="fp-icon__link fp-id-16407 gb_unavailable fp-news-icon" title="Open Player Card" data-fp-id="16407" data-fp-index="9"><span class="fp-icon__icon"></span></a></div>: ADP 199.6 | RB61</b></p><p>Unfortunately, <a class="fp-player-link fp-id-16393" href="https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/players/christian-mccaffrey.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-fp-id="16393">Christian McCaffrey</a><div class="fp-icon__container"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="fp-icon__link fp-id-16393 gb_unavailable fp-news-icon" title="Open Player Card" data-fp-id="16393" data-fp-index="10"><span class="fp-icon__icon"></span></a></div>has played only 10 games the past two years because of injuries.
